### Background
I'm working mostly as a backend developer using PHP as my main language for about 5 years, counting part-time jobs. In beginning of my journey with web development I really hated JavaScript - I used jQuery at this time (because it was clearly the most popular JS library used in almost every "modern" websites). For me it was frustrating writing anything on front of apps, so mainly I utilized jQuery for calling AJAX request to backend I was writing and for small DOM modifications like checking buttons, validating inputs, changing styles etc.

This changed when I first met ReactJS - a library popularized by Facebook for creating reactive frontend apps. I was excited about possibilities of creating frontend apps with great performance which improves user experience as final result. But there was a barrier that I couldn't break - my poor knowledge of ES6 and JSX concept. I left React and tried to search something similar. This is how I felt in love in VueJS.
