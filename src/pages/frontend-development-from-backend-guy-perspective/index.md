## Background
I'm working mostly as a backend developer using PHP as my main language for about 5 years counting part-time jobs. In beginning of my journey with web development i really hated JavaScript - I used jQuery mostly at this time (because it was clearly the most popular JS library used in almost every "modern" websites). For me it was frustrating writing anything on front of apps, so mainly i utilized jQuery for calling AJAX request to backend I was writing and for small DOM modifications like checking buttons, validating inputs, changing styles etc.
