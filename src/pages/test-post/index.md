This is some kind of testing new architecture based on Markdown fetching with Gatsby.  

## What can i do with that?

  

Well, you can so do so many things. First, we need to find some Markdown editor to make blogging easier. I found an online tool named [Stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io). It feels easy and suitable for all my needs.
 
Second, you can embed pretty much everything with this setup.

    ## you can embed your code too!

Youtube video works as well.
