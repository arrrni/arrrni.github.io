Do you have some ‚Äúwonderful start-up idea‚Äù that you thought would shock the whole world? Maybe you have some kind of blog that was not updated for like 3 years or so? You know what I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Probably your answer to one of the given questions was affirmative. I‚Äôve described myself there because this issue called straw enthusiasm is my biggest struggle in terms of side projects and developing my skills in certain areas of my life. Even this blog is proof of this statement. I haven‚Äôt deleted these two previous posts because it reminds me what I‚Äôm doing wrong. There was a plan to build a personal brand for me - start a blog in English, then maybe some YouTube channel to build up a community and to promote myself as a valuable developer in this highly competitive market. And as for making YouTube content, I can have some excuse, for example being shy in front of the camera (but the bigger problem will be connected to the rest of the stuff that I‚Äôm trying to create), for blogging it is straight losing the interest of this topic.</p>\n<p>If you‚Äôre reading this you can wonder - why you lose your attraction to a current subject so fast? Well‚Ä¶ I think that is related to my self-confidence which is low in the case of making creative things. The second problem is that I‚Äôm very critical of myself and of things that I create. And that is my biggest flaw that I‚Äôm trying to eliminate my whole life and can‚Äôt jump over it easily. I envy people for their uncritical approach to themselves - I just can‚Äôt think like that and it makes me so helpless in kind of continuous development of myself.</p>\n<p>So why I decided to dust off this blog from the abandoned projects shelf? From the time that the last post of this blog was written (unfinished, btw üôÉ) my life changed drastically - now I have a wife and kids which obliges me to be a responsible and serious man, the father, the head of the family. It motivates me to fight with all issues mentioned earlier and to be a better person for my family and myself. Despite making this site my brand blog I decided to make it more like a diary of my progress with struggles. Also, I‚Äôm not resigning from writing technical stuff hereafter short vacation I have scheduled to finish this post about frontend from a backend perspective (which was mentioned there recently). Many things changed in my work experience, global pandemic has an impact on this also so it would be nice to write something about it here. I have learned one language that I made my pocket pick in case of doing some fast things (f.e. scripts, fast data processing) and I want to mention it here also. Need to list all of my unfinished projects here also and its count. I‚Äôm afraid that this number could have two digits‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>And that‚Äôs it for now - a short update about my current state of being. See you soon I hope. Or again after three years on another Gatsby update üòÇ (it will be sooner than later, I promise).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"So much projects, so few resources...","categories":["Stories","Personal"],"date":"June 02, 2021"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/so-much-projects-so-few-resources/","previous":{"id":"23e9ea19-e1a7-5c88-9a10-898bb016d32f","fields":{"slug":"/frontend-development-from-backend-guy-perspective/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frontend development from backend guy's perspective.","categories":["Stories","Development"]}},"next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["817046356"]}
