At beginning of my journey with web development, I hated JavaScript - I used jQuery at this time (because it was the most popular JS library used in almost every “modern” website). For me, it was frustrating writing anything in front of apps, so mainly I utilized jQuery for calling AJAX requests to the backend I was writing and for small DOM modifications like checking buttons, validating inputs, changing styles, etc.</p>\n<p>This changed when I first met ReactJS - a library popularized by Facebook for creating reactive frontend apps. I was excited about the possibilities of creating frontend apps with great performance which improves user experience as the final result. But there was a barrier that I couldn’t break - my poor knowledge of ES6 and JSX concept. I left React and tried to search for something similar. This is how I fell in love with VueJS.</p>\n<h3>Begginings</h3>\n<article class=\"message is-info\">\n  <div class=\"message-header\">\n    <p>Information</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"message-body\">\n    There should be a continuation of this article but by the time it was abandoned by me many things changed.
